In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing everything about the project in that I participated.\nWhat is the challenge for? It is designed for youths between 14-21, allowing them to learn real-life challenges. The challenges occur each year with the theme changing, which significantly helps with the technological changes with the inclusion of spending a day of naval life and spending the night onboard HMS Bristol.\nThe challenge The challenge was based on the integrated system in which two remote-controlled (RC) vehicles had to retrieve the stranded helicopter and transport it back to safety. The RC vehicle was a land-based recovery vehicle and a ship vessel. Both of them had to be moved using one controller.\nIt was a group project that took over the course of a few months to construct the RC vehicles. A list of types of equipment was given to choose from, and how much it costed. This gave a good opportunity for budget control, and we needed to be precise about what was needed to pull the challenge off. Henceforth we researched extensively what core materials should be required to build an RC vehicle. We did have a spare budget left but used it to buy extra materials. The next phase was to construct the initial design using AutoCAD and Solidworks 3D. We did come up with a few designs, but they did come with their strengths and flaws. However, a final design was made.\nThe materials soon arrived, and we started assembling the vessel and car. For the vessel, blue styrofoam was used for the body as it was waterproof and light, thus minimising the weight overall, as well as using an acrylic layer to prevent the vessel from sinking (several testing was conducted in a demo sink with many materials). All of the electric components, like the rudder, servo, battery etc., were stored in the vessel base, so they had to be concealed properly.\nSimilar to the car, which was made compact and lightweight as both they and the down-bird helicopter had to be on the vessel.\nThere was a total of two attempts to complete the task. One was in the morning, and the other took place in the afternoon (which gave us time to improve and modify the design from the first attempt.\nHowever, we were unsuccessful on both tries. The vessel was successfully moving in the water, and the car was able to leave the vessel and collect the down-bird helicopter. But you must be wondering what the issue was? Well\u0026hellip; the crane hook could only move in a straight motion, either up or down. It could have been better if it had been able to move directions and not locked to a single axis. The other issue was the vessel\u0026rsquo;s trust was a water flush, so it only could move forward, it was difficult to manage (and we managed to control it), but the design could have been tweaked.\nWhat was taken from the challenge A lot was learnt throughout the project. I really had fun throughout it all. Designing, making and preparing played a major factor. It helped me understand what I needed to do and achieve. My time management was tested as we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a long time to complete it as well as it was my first time making a project like this which was a learning curve.
