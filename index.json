[{"content":"Introduction In the post, we will talk about mid-journey an AI technology capable to generate images from text.\nMidjourney Mid-journey AI, also known as mid-adoption AI, refers to the point in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology where progress has been made, but the full potential of the technology has not yet been reached. At this stage, organizations and individuals are using AI technology in a limited capacity, and may not have fully realized its potential benefits.\nOne example of mid-journey AI is the (AI image generator, which uses machine learning algorithms to create new images based on a set of inputs. While the technology is able to generate new images, they may not be of the same quality or realism as images created by human designers. Additionally, the technology may not have been fully integrated into the relevant industry or field, and its use may be limited to specific tasks or applications.\nMid-journey AI can also refer to the stage in which an organization or individual has started to implement AI technology, but is still in the process of fully understanding its capabilities and limitations. The organization may not have fully integrated AI into their operations and may still be in the process of testing and evaluating the technology.\nHow to generate images? Currently the only way to generate images is from its discord server (do note that it’s a beta server , changes are constantly being made). Make an account if you haven’t already and join with link provided.\nhttps://discord.com/invite/midjourney\nNow head over to any newcomer rooms Now type the image you want to be generated. For this example, we will create a AI image of Harry potter and the flash’s Barry Allen (with the addition of a 4k image and realistic lighting). The more you specify the better the results, but input the command as shown below.\nLet the bot do its work and your image will be generated in the meanwhile. Each image created will show four variations The images can be either up-scaled or variations can be made again. But in this I will upscale version three. The final Result: Just a head up everyone a limited trial (around 25 queries), and then several options to buy a full membership.\nWrap up There we go, quite the image generated so far\u0026hellip;. but this is just the beginning. Just imagine the possible development that it can achieve such as:\nImproved image quality: AI image generators will continue to improve in terms of image quality, realism, and diversity. This will be achieved by using more advanced deep learning techniques and larger and more diverse training datasets.\nGreater integration with other technologies: AI image generators will increasingly be integrated with other technologies such as virtual and augmented reality, allowing for the creation of more immersive and interactive experiences.\nAutomation and scalability: AI image generators will become more automated and scalable, making them easier to use and accessible to a wider range of users. This will enable more efficient and cost-effective image generation.\nEthical concerns: As AI image generators become more advanced, there will be increasing ethical concerns about their use, particularly when it comes to creating images of people. Efforts will be made to ensure that the technology is used responsibly and in compliance with privacy and data protection regulations.\nCloud-based solutions: More AI image generators will be cloud-based solutions, which will allow for easy access and scalability, and can also help to lower the cost of ownership.\nOverall, the future of mid-journey AI image generators looks promising, with the potential to revolutionise various industries with more realistic and diverse images, greater integration with other technologies, more automation, scalability and ethical concerns.\n","permalink":"https://harshalmandaliya.com/posts/image-ai/","summary":"Introduction In the post, we will talk about mid-journey an AI technology capable to generate images from text.\nMidjourney Mid-journey AI, also known as mid-adoption AI, refers to the point in the development and implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) technology where progress has been made, but the full potential of the technology has not yet been reached.

In this post, I\u0026rsquo;ll be sharing everything about the project in that I participated.\nWhat is the challenge for? It is designed for youths between 14-21, allowing them to learn real-life challenges. The challenges occur each year with the theme changing, which significantly helps with the technological changes with the inclusion of spending a day of naval life and spending the night onboard HMS Bristol.\nThe challenge The challenge was based on the integrated system in which two remote-controlled (RC) vehicles had to retrieve the stranded helicopter and transport it back to safety. The RC vehicle was a land-based recovery vehicle and a ship vessel. Both of them had to be moved using one controller.\nIt was a group project that took over the course of a few months to construct the RC vehicles. A list of types of equipment was given to choose from, and how much it costed. This gave a good opportunity for budget control, and we needed to be precise about what was needed to pull the challenge off. Henceforth we researched extensively what core materials should be required to build an RC vehicle. We did have a spare budget left but used it to buy extra materials. The next phase was to construct the initial design using AutoCAD and Solidworks 3D. We did come up with a few designs, but they did come with their strengths and flaws. However, a final design was made.\nThe materials soon arrived, and we started assembling the vessel and car. For the vessel, blue styrofoam was used for the body as it was waterproof and light, thus minimising the weight overall, as well as using an acrylic layer to prevent the vessel from sinking (several testing was conducted in a demo sink with many materials). All of the electric components, like the rudder, servo, battery etc., were stored in the vessel base, so they had to be concealed properly.\nSimilar to the car, which was made compact and lightweight as both they and the down-bird helicopter had to be on the vessel.\nThere was a total of two attempts to complete the task. One was in the morning, and the other took place in the afternoon (which gave us time to improve and modify the design from the first attempt.\nHowever, we were unsuccessful on both tries. The vessel was successfully moving in the water, and the car was able to leave the vessel and collect the down-bird helicopter. But you must be wondering what the issue was? Well\u0026hellip; the crane hook could only move in a straight motion, either up or down. It could have been better if it had been able to move directions and not locked to a single axis. The other issue was the vessel\u0026rsquo;s trust was a water flush, so it only could move forward, it was difficult to manage (and we managed to control it), but the design could have been tweaked.\nWhat was taken from the challenge A lot was learnt throughout the project. I really had fun throughout it all. Designing, making and preparing played a major factor. It helped me understand what I needed to do and achieve. My time management was tested as we didn\u0026rsquo;t have a long time to complete it as well as it was my first time making a project like this which was a learning curve.
