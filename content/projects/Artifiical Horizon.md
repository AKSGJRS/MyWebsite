# Introduction
The project is based on the Fly-by-wire (FBW) which is a system that replaces all of the conventional manual plane cockpit display to an electronic interface. A new cockpit display was created which provides FBW including several other aircraft control commands that are necessary. The new interface is designed to replace the ordinary manual flight controls of normal aircrafts while also providing additional control commands. The program was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio as a Windows Form Application.
